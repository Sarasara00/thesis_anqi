Measuring the Similarity Between Graph Representations of GIS Workflows in Geo-analytical QA
The expert and generated workflows are stored in the 'data' folder. 
The code is divided into two parts: the code in the 'graph-to-ttl' folder is used for data preparation, while the code in the 'src' folder is used to calculate similarity using two methods. 
The 'workflow_evaluation' folder contains the source data for evaluation and the final evaluation document.
